### 🌐 Open Source

I ♥ Open Source software. This is a overview of the probjects I've published as open-source

#### Ollama EasyPHPRompt
This is a test project for Ollama with Symfony, using it locally as an LLM (Large Language Model). 

With this project, you can easily reuse and manage "Prompt Types" to streamline your requests. You can also use these prompt types with your own API integrations with the provided API.

#### PHPersonal notes
A personal notes application I've build.

Symfony PHP Framework is used to build API endpoints. This way you are can create your own front-end to interact with the application.
But there is also an VueJS/Vuetify front-end is included to interact with the app!
